# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. 

### Purpose

Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Based on the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date, it looks as though there were more successful theater outcomes compared to failed and canceled throughout various launch dates. In addition, there are no canceled theater outcomes in October.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Based on the Outcomes Based on Goals, it looks as though there was a higher percentage of successful outcomes based on goals less than 15,000 and between 35,000 and 40,000 compared to percentage of failed outcomes.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Possible challenges and difficulties that could be encountered included making sure the correct data was being filtered for plays and the correct calculations were done.

## Results

Based on the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date, it looks as though May is the most successful month for a theater to have a lauch date. In addition, October does not have any canceled theater outcomes, however there is a higher than average failed outcome for theaters in October as well.

Based on the Outcomes Based on Goals, it looks as though the percentage of successful outcomes is the highest when the goal is less than 1,000, so Louise should plan to keep her goals relatively low when planning her fundraiser.

The limitations of the dataset include no data for any canceled theater outcomes, and a recommendation for additional tables or graphs include tables for how close did Louise's play Fever get to its fundraising goal over what period of time so that Louise can see how she can improve her fundraising goals.
